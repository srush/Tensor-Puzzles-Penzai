# Tensor Puzzles Penzai

This is an implementation of the [Tensor Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles) written in the new [Penzai](https://penzai.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) Jax framework. 


It is meant to test out both the automatic visualization and named tensor support of the library.
